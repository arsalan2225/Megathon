Natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, pose significant threats to ecosystems, infrastructure, and human safety. This project aims to develop a predictive model utilizing satellite data to assess the likelihood of these disasters by analysing various factors. Such as monitoring the movement of ground, small shifts in tectonic plates, monitoring soil moisture, observing inundated areas, and measuring rainfall, by detecting the vibrations in the atmosphere for tsunamis, we will provide training, validation and testing data sets for training model efficiently. We are using certain machine learning algorithms in our model including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbours. We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for creating a web application that will allow users to register based on their location and preferences for receiving alerts related to various disasters such as earthquakes and floods. By integrating geolocation services and real-time communication technologies, the app will provide timely notifications and critical information about emergency resources. Additionally, the platform will provide an AI chat assistant to solve their real time queries regarding Disasters.
